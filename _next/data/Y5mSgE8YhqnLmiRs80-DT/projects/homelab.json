If you look hard enough, you will see that the fan of the bottom layer is in a slightly different place and the standoffs are slightly shorter.\n\nThe cluster was later repurposed to learn [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com) when the Raspberry Pi 2s became a little too slow to run Docker.\n\n## Upgraded\n\n![Updated Raspberry Pi cluster for Docker Swarm](/assets/blog/homelab/raspberry-pi-3-cluster.jpg)\n\nI got this case from eBay, it was not in the best shape, very dusty and scratched, it cost me £68.55 but it did contain 3 Raspberry Pi 3s (including one with broken Wifi and Bluetooth) and a few Micro USB Chargers Ethernet cables. The case also came with a switch that fits at the bottom perfectly.\n\nI cleaned it up with some isopropyl alcohol and re-assembled it with some new screws as some of them were quite rusted.\n\nI assembled this cluster to learn all about Containerization using [Docker Swarm mode](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm) and eventually, Kubernetes using [MicroK8s](https://microk8s.io/), however the Raspberry Pi 3s are a little too slow to fully run a K8s cluster with more than a handful of containers.\n\n## Current\n\n![8086 Cluster Hat with 4 Raspberry Pi Zeros](/assets/blog/homelab/raspberry-pi-zero-cluster.jpg)\n\nMy Raspberry Pi Zero cluster was assembled using a 8086 Cluster Hat that is quite cool due to it using USB gadget mode of the Raspberry Pi Zero to boot up the Raspberry Pis over USB therefore they do not require their own MicroSD cards and can share the storage of the controller Pi... However after some testing, adding their own SD cards speeds up disk reads and writes considerably under load.\n\n# Rack\n\n## Modular 10\" Server Rack\n\n| Item                                                                      | Quantity | Material                                             | Size | Weight | Cost | Printed | Notes |\n| ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ---- | ------ | ---- | :-----: | ----- |\n| [1U_40mm_Fans_MOD10](https://www.printables.com/model/1225275)            | 1        | [eSun ABS+ (Red)](printer-filament#esun-abs-red)     |      |        |      |   :x:   |       |\n| [8_Port_Keystone_MOD10](https://www.printables.com/model/1225275)         | 1        | [eSun ABS+ (Red)](printer-filament#esun-abs-red)     |      |        |      |   :x:   |       |\n| [Handle_MOD10](https://www.printables.com/model/1225275)                  | 2        | [eSun ABS+ (Red)](printer-filament#esun-abs-red)     |      |        |      |   :x:   |       |\n| [Lid_Solid_MOD10](https://www.printables.com/model/1225275)               | 1        | [eSun ABS+ (Red)](printer-filament#esun-abs-red)     |      |        |      |   :x:   |       |\n| [Lid_Vented_MOD10](https://www.printables.com/model/1225275)              | 1        | [eSun ABS+ (Red)](printer-filament#esun-abs-red)     |      |        |      |   :x:   |       |\n| [Mod_10_Foot](https://www.printables.com/model/1225275)                   | 4        | [Ziro TPU (Black)](printer-filament#ziro-tpu-black)  |      |        |      |   :x:   |       |\n| [MOD10_Crossmembers](https://www.printables.com/model/1225275)            | 4        | [eSun ABS+ (Black)](printer-filament#esun-abs-black) |      |        |      |   :x:   |       |\n| [MOD10_Front_Back_Connectors](https://www.printables.com/model/1225275)   | 8        | [eSun ABS+ (Red)](printer-filament#esun-abs-red)     |      |        |      |   :x:   |       |\n| [MOD10_Mid_Modular_Sections_2U](https://www.printables.com/model/1225275) | 2        | [eSun ABS+ (Black)](printer-filament#esun-abs-black) |      |        |      |   :x:   |       |\n| [MOD10_Side_Connectors](https://www.printables.com/model/1225275)         | 8        | [eSun ABS+ (Red)](printer-filament#esun-abs-red)     |      |        |      |   :x:   |       |\n| [MOD10_Top_Bottom_2U](https://www.printables.com/model/1225275)           | 4        | [eSun ABS+ (Black)](printer-filament#esun-abs-black) |      |        |      |   :x:   |       |\n\n## M920Q 10\" Rack Mount\n\n| Item                                                                              | Quantity | Material                                         | Size | Weight | Cost | Printed | Notes |\n| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ---- | ------ | ---- | :-----: | ----- |\n| [Lenovo Thinkcentre Tiny 1U Rack Mount](https://www.printables.com/model/1040412) | 2        | [eSun ABS+ (Red)](printer-filament#esun-abs-red) |      |        |      |   :x:   |       |\n\n## Raspberry Pi 10\" Rack Mount\n\n| Item                                                                         | Quantity | Material                                             | Size | Weight | Cost | Printed | Notes |\n| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ---- | ------ | ---- | :-----: | ----- |\n| [10' -

I ended up with 3 of these umbrella lights, 2 to illuminate the screen and one to illuminate my whilst I played.\nEventually I upgraded the bulbs to hue colour changing ones to allow me to sync the colours being projected on my with what was happening on screen.\n\n![Beat Saber in front of a green screen](/assets/blog/homelab/beat-saber.jpg)\n\nAn early example of what the video looked like after composition.\n","lastmod":null},"related":[{"slug":"thinkcenter","related":[],"external":[],"title":"Thinkcenter","heading":"","date":"","preview":"/assets/blog/thinkcenter/thinkcenter-hero.jpg","author":{"name":"","picture":""},"description":"","tags":[],"categories":[],"keywords":[],"promoted":false,"content":""},{"slug":"thinkpad","related":[],"external":[],"title":"Thinkpads","heading":"","date":"","preview":"/assets/blog/thinkpad/thinkpad-hero.jpg","author":{"name":"","picture":""},"description":"","tags":[],"categories":[],"keywords":[],"promoted":false,"content":""},{"slug":"single-board-computers","related":[],"external":[],"title":"Single Board Computers","heading":"","date":"","preview":"/assets/blog/single-board-computers/single-board-computers-hero.jpg","author":{"name":"","picture":""},"description":"","tags":[],"categories":[],"keywords":[],"promoted":false,"content":""}]},"__N_SSG":true}
