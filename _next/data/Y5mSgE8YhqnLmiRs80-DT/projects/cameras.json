Although it is quite heavily scratched, it now works perfectly.\n\n# Nikon\n\n![My Nikon cameras with some accessories](/assets/blog/cameras/nikon-cameras.jpg)\n\n## F-801\n\n![A Nikon F-801 Film Camera](/assets/blog/cameras/nikon-f-801.jpg)\n\nI brought this film camera as it has a Nikon F-Mount, the same lens mount as my DSLR camera allowing me to re-use lenses.\n\n![Film photograph of my Nikon F-801](/assets/blog/cameras/nikon-f-801-on-film.jpg)\n\n> This photo was taken on my [Minolta XG-M](#xg-m)\n\n## D3100\n\n![Nikon D3100 with a Tamaron lens fully extended](/assets/blog/cameras/nikon-d3100-lens-extended.jpg)\n\nMy first ever Digital SLR camera.\n\n![Digital Camera on a Tripod](/assets/blog/cameras/tripod.jpg)\n\n## D7000\n\n![Screen on the top of a Nikon D7000](/assets/blog/cameras/nikon-d7000-screen.jpg)\n\nI traded in my [Nikon D3100](#d3100) to [CEX](https://uk.webuy.com/) to purchase this.\n\n![Screen on the back of a Nikon D7000](/assets/blog/cameras/nikon-d7000-back.jpg)\n\n# Praktica\n\n## BMS\n\nI have owned 2 of these however both have broken, failing to wind on.\n\n## BC-1\n\n![A Praktica BC 1 Film Camera](/assets/blog/cameras/praktica-bc-1.jpg)\n\nMy only working Praktica camera left\n\n# Zenith\n\n## Zenit-E\n\n![A Zenit-E Film Camera](/assets/blog/cameras/zenit-e.jpg)\n\nI have 2 Zenit-E cameras, one in Black and one in Silver.
