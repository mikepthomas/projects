          <p>
            I have a keen interest in the Royal Air Force and the military in
            general; I have flown a winch powered glider, have taken part in
            aerobatics in a fixed-wing aircraft and completed an Accelerated
            Free Fall Skydiving course in which I have skydived 13 times.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was a member of the Royal Naval Reserves in my spare time, and
            contributed to SkydiveUWE and the Technology society during my time
            at University.
          </p>
          <p>
            My other hobbies include music, learning to play bass guitar,
            computer games modification, Virtual reality and motorbikes. I have
            recently been learning all about 3D printing and 3D modelling in
            Fusion 360.
