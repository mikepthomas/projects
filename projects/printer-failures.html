Seems like it&#x27;s the most common failure in 3D printing, make sure to level the bed and then level it again. This probably failed due to the nozzle being too far off the bed on the first layer as the filament did not &quot;squish&quot; to the bed. Once the bed had been relevelled, <a href="/projects/printer#finished">the print came out great</a>.</p><h2 id="cable-chain">Cable Chain</h2><p><span style="opacity:0"><img alt="Cables not fitting in cable chain" loading="lazy" width="1280" height="960" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="img-fluid img-thumbnail" style="color:transparent" src="/assets/blog/printer-failures/cable-chain.jpg"/></span></p><p>This was more of a failure of printing the wrong thing, I printed the fully enclosed cable chain links, and only when coming to fit them, did I find that the cables did not fit through the chain. I had to re-assemble everything to get back printing some new links that use cable ties to hold the cables in the chain.</p><h2 id="melted-part-fan-duct">Melted Part Fan Duct</h2><p><span style="opacity:0"><img alt="Hot nozzle through fan duct" loading="lazy" width="1280" height="960" decoding="async" data-nimg="1" class="img-fluid img-thumbnail" style="color:transparent" src="/assets/blog/printer-failures/fan-duct-melted.jpg"/></span></p><p>This one came down to user error, I had a jam in the hotend and had to disassemble the extruder to clear it. Once the jam was clear, I heated the nozzle to insert some filament. After starting a new print I noticed that I had forgotten to re-attach the part cooling fan duct.

The best thing about building a printer from scratch, is that you also know how to repair it.\n\n# First Print\n\n![My first ever print](/assets/blog/printer-failures/first-print.jpg)\n\nMy first ever print, my first ever failure... Seems like it's the most common failure in 3D printing, make sure to level the bed and then level it again. This probably failed due to the nozzle being too far off the bed on the first layer as the filament did not \"squish\" to the bed. Once the bed had been relevelled, [the print came out great](printer#finished).\n\n# Cable Chain\n\n![Cables not fitting in cable chain](/assets/blog/printer-failures/cable-chain.jpg)\n\nThis was more of a failure of printing the wrong thing, I printed the fully enclosed cable chain links, and only when coming to fit them, did I find that the cables did not fit through the chain. I had to re-assemble everything to get back printing some new links that use cable ties to hold the cables in the chain.\n\n# Melted Part Fan Duct\n\n![Hot nozzle through fan duct](/assets/blog/printer-failures/fan-duct-melted.jpg)\n\nThis one came down to user error, I had a jam in the hotend and had to disassemble the extruder to clear it. Once the jam was clear, I heated the nozzle to insert some filament. After starting a new print I noticed that I had forgotten to re-attach the part cooling fan duct. Being lazy, I did not want to cancel and restart the print so I tried to re-attach the duct whilst the printer was homing the Z axis, however, I was not quick enough and the hot nozzle squished the duct into the bed. Lesson learned as I then had spend more time to reprint a new duct.\n\n# Broken Extruder Cooling Fan\n\n![Allen key in cooling fan](/assets/blog/printer-failures/cooling-fan-broken.jpg)\n\nAnother occurence of user error, I was attempting to print flexible TPU filament for the first time, however, I think I was trying to print it too fast and too cool as the filament kept wrapping around the gears in the extruder. The gears on the Anet A8 are hidden behind the hotend cooling fan and heatsink, held on by two socket head screws. To remove them you need to use an allen key, this is best done whilst the printer is off as my allen key slipped and went straight into the cooling fan sheering off some of the blades.\n\n![Replacement Noctua fan](/assets/blog/printer-failures/cooling-fan-noctua.jpg)\n\nThere was an upside to this as I replaced the (quite noisy) stock fan with a [small noctua fan](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B009NQLT0M) which made the printer a fair bit quieter whilst switched on.
