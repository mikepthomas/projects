# Intro

This project was to assemble a cheap 3D printer with the premise to eventually make it better by upgrading components and 3D printing improved parts.

# Assembly

## Frame

![](https://github.com/mikepthomas/mikepthomas.github.io/raw/develop/src/img/printer/01-before-assembly.jpg)

The kit comes nicely packed in these polystyrene trays keeping things nice and protected.

The top and bottom support plates get fixed to the side support plates making up the main part of the frame.

And finally the support plate lock plates tie them together.

## Y Axis

![](https://github.com/mikepthomas/mikepthomas.github.io/raw/develop/src/img/printer/04-y-axis-motor.jpg)

The Y axis motor is secured to the back plate by the Y axis motor fixed plate and the Y limit switch is fixed into place with the Y axis limit switch fixed plate.

![](https://github.com/mikepthomas/mikepthomas.github.io/raw/develop/src/img/printer/05-rear-frame.jpg)

The back plate is then attached to the rear of the frame.

![](https://github.com/mikepthomas/mikepthomas.github.io/raw/develop/src/img/printer/06-y-axis-tensioner.jpg)

The Y axis bearing support is attached to the front plate.

![](https://github.com/mikepthomas/mikepthomas.github.io/raw/develop/src/img/printer/07-y-axis-install.jpg)

The front plate is then attached to the main frame using the 400mm M8 threaded rods and 12 M8 nuts and washers.

![](https://github.com/mikepthomas/mikepthomas.github.io/raw/develop/src/img/printer/08-y-axis-rods.jpg)

2 linear bearing blocks are threaded onto 2 of the 380mm smooth rods and then affixed next to the threaded rods. These are held in place with 4 guide rod back up plates.

## Heated Bed

![](https://github.com/mikepthomas/mikepthomas.github.io/raw/develop/src/img/printer/09-bed-carriage.jpg)

Two Y axis fixation clamps are loosely screwed to the hot bed fixed aluminium plate, these will hold the ends of the belt later.

![](https://github.com/mikepthomas/mikepthomas.github.io/raw/develop/src/img/printer/10-bed-carriage-install.jpg)

The hot bed aluminium plate is then attached to the linear bearing blocks.

![](https://github.com/mikepthomas/mikepthomas.github.io/raw/develop/src/img/printer/11-y-belt.jpg)

The Y axis belt is then installed and the carriage is moved back and forth along the rails to ensure the travel is smooth.

![](https://github.com/mikepthomas/mikepthomas.github.io/raw/develop/src/img/printer/12-heated-bed.jpg)

The heated bed is then attached to the hot bed aluminium plate with 4 springs and wing nuts to allow the bed to be levelled.

## Z Axis

![](https://github.com/mikepthomas/mikepthomas.github.io/raw/develop/src/img/printer/13-z-axis-motors.jpg)

The Z axis motors are attached to the Z axis motor fixed plates and then attached to the frame with the 4 Z axis support plates. The Z axis limit switch is then affixed to the frame with the Z axis limit switch fixed plate.

![](https://github.com/mikepthomas/mikepthomas.github.io/raw/develop/src/img/printer/14-z-axis-rods.jpg)

The Z axis nut supports are each added to the last two 380mm smooth rods and then threaded through the support plate lock plates at the top of the frame. These are held in place with the two remaining guide rod back up plates.

![](https://github.com/mikepthomas/mikepthomas.github.io/raw/develop/src/img/printer/15-lead-screws.jpg)

The two 345mm 8mm lead screws are then threaded through the nut supports and fixed to the Z motors.

## X Axis

![](https://github.com/mikepthomas/mikepthomas.github.io/raw/develop/src/img/printer/16-x-axis-rods.jpg)

3 linear bearing blocks are added to the two 436mm guide rods, 2 on the top rod 1 on the bottom and then press fitted into the nut supports.

![](https://github.com/mikepthomas/mikepthomas.github.io/raw/develop/src/img/printer/17-extruder.jpg)

The extruder assembly is assembled.

![](https://github.com/mikepthomas/mikepthomas.github.io/raw/develop/src/img/printer/18-x-axis-carriage.jpg)

The X axis carriage is then attached to the X axis linear bearing blocks.

![](https://github.com/mikepthomas/mikepthomas.github.io/raw/develop/src/img/printer/19-extruder-install.jpg)

And the extruder is attached to the carriage.

![](https://github.com/mikepthomas/mikepthomas.github.io/raw/develop/src/img/printer/20-part-cooling-fan.jpg)

The part cooling fan is fixed to the front of the carriage.

![](https://github.com/mikepthomas/mikepthomas.github.io/raw/develop/src/img/printer/21-x-axis-motor.jpg)

The X axis motor is attached to the left Z axis nut support.

![](https://github.com/mikepthomas/mikepthomas.github.io/raw/develop/src/img/printer/22-x-axis-complete.jpg)

The X axis belt is then installed and the carriage is moved back and forth along the rails to ensure the travel is smooth.

## Electronics

![](https://github.com/mikepthomas/mikepthomas.github.io/raw/develop/src/img/printer/23-display.jpg)

the LCD 2004 screen is installed into the frame sandwiched between the top support plate and the screen baffle plate.

![](https://github.com/mikepthomas/mikepthomas.github.io/raw/develop/src/img/printer/24-power-supply.jpg)

The 12V power supply is fixed into place on the right of the frame.

![](https://github.com/mikepthomas/mikepthomas.github.io/raw/develop/src/img/printer/25-control-board.jpg)

The control board is fixed into place on the left side of the frame.

![](https://github.com/mikepthomas/mikepthomas.github.io/raw/develop/src/img/printer/26-wiring.jpg)

The various wires are then plugged into the correct spots on the power supply and control board.

## Testing

![](https://github.com/mikepthomas/mikepthomas.github.io/raw/develop/src/img/printer/27-initial-power-on.jpg)

After double checking the wires are plugged into place in the correct polarity the printer is turned on for the first time.

![](https://github.com/mikepthomas/mikepthomas.github.io/raw/develop/src/img/printer/28-she-lives.jpg)

Always good to see that something is displayed on the screen.

![](https://github.com/mikepthomas/mikepthomas.github.io/raw/develop/src/img/printer/29-wire-management.jpg)

The wires are then tidied up with the included spiral wrap to keep them getting snagged on any moving parts.

## Finished

The hello world of the 3D printing world... the first print had to be a [3D Benchy](https://www.3dbenchy.com/).

# Safety Upgrades

![](https://github.com/mikepthomas/mikepthomas.github.io/raw/develop/src/img/printer/safety-upgrades.jpg)

The Anet A8 has [a bit of a reputation](https://www.fabbaloo.com/2018/12/3d-printer-safety-another-anet-a8-burns) for [catching on fire and burning your house down](https://www.thissmarthouse.net/dont-burn-your-house-down-3d-printing-a-cautionary-tale/) these upgrades are a must to ensure safety of using the printer.

- 30A power supply
- Mosfets
- Enable Thermal runaway in Marlin

I also ran 2 more cables to the heated bed to spread the current load between the extra pins on the heated bed as if the existing pins become loose they will melt the connector.

# Auto Bed Levelling

To enable auto bed levelling on the printer I used a Tronxy XY-08N.

![](https://github.com/mikepthomas/mikepthomas.github.io/raw/develop/src/img/printer/auto-level-sensor.jpg)

The firmware to enable the sensor is available on [my Marlin Github repository](https://github.com/mikepthomas/Marlin/tree/2.0.x-Anet3D-V1-5)
