# Table of contents

# Intro

This project was to assemble a cheap 3D printer with the premise to eventually make it better by upgrading components and 3D printing improved parts.

# Assembly

![An unassembled Anet A8 in original packaging](/assets/blog/printer/01-before-assembly.jpg)

The kit comes nicely packed in these polystyrene trays keeping things nice and protected.

## Frame

### :white_check_mark: Assembly Step 1

### :white_check_mark: Assembly Step 7

![Installing the Y-Axis bearings and smooth rods](/assets/blog/printer/08-y-axis-rods.jpg)

2 linear bearing blocks are threaded onto 2 of the 380mm smooth rods and then affixed next to the threaded rods. These are held in place with 4 guide rod back up plates.

#### Parts Used

## Heated Bed

### :white_check_mark: Assembly Step 8

![Screwing the Bed Carriage together](/assets/blog/printer/09-bed-carriage.jpg)

Two Y axis fixation clamps are loosely screwed to the hot bed fixed aluminium plate, these will hold the ends of the belt later.

**_NOTE:_** The belt fixation clamps are attached on the opposite side of the hot bed fixed aluminium plate here compared to the manual. I did this intentially as this lowers the attachment point of the belt allowing the belts to be more parallel than on the stock build.

#### Parts Used

| Item                          | Quantity |
| ----------------------------- | -------- |
| Hot bed fixed aluminium plate | 1        |

### :white_check_mark: Assembly Step 10

![Installing the belt to the bed](/assets/blog/printer/11-y-belt.jpg)

The Y axis belt is then installed and the carriage is moved back and forth along the rails to ensure the travel is smooth.

#### Parts Used

| Item | Quantity |
| ---- | -------- |
| Belt | 1        |

### :white_check_mark: Assembly Step 11

![Adding the heated bed with adjusting springs](/assets/blog/printer/12-heated-bed.jpg)

The heated bed is then attached to the hot bed aluminium plate with 4 springs and wing nuts to allow the bed to be levelled.

**_NOTE:_** I added M3 Nuts here before adding the springs to stop the screws rotating in the countersink of the heated bed when adjusting the bed with the wing nuts.

#### Parts Used

| Item                        | Quantity |
| --------------------------- | -------- |

| M3 wing nut                 | 4        |

## Z Axis

### :white_check_mark: Assembly Step 12

![Z-Axis motors and limit switch installed](/assets/blog/printer/13-z-axis-motors.jpg)

The Z axis motors are attached to the Z axis motor fixed plates and then attached to the frame with the 4 Z axis support plates. The Z axis limit switch is then affixed to the frame with the Z axis limit switch fixed plate.

#### Parts Used

| Item                            | Quantity |
| ------------------------------- | -------- |

![Adding in the lead screws](/assets/blog/printer/15-lead-screws.jpg)

The two 345mm 8mm lead screws are then threaded through the nut supports and fixed to the Z motors.

**_NOTE:_** There needs to be a slight gap between the lead screws and the motor shafts to allow a little bit of flex in the couplers.

## Testing

![Not letting out the magic smoke](/assets/blog/printer/27-initial-power-on.jpg)

After double checking the wires are plugged into place in the correct polarity the printer is turned on for the first time.

![Printer booted up for the first time](/assets/blog/printer/28-she-lives.jpg)

Always good to see that something is displayed on the screen.

![Tidying up the wiring](/assets/blog/printer/29-wire-management.jpg)

The wires are then tidied up with the included spiral wrap to keep them getting snagged on any moving parts.

## Finished

![First ever print on the printer; a Benchy boat](/assets/blog/printer/30-first-print.jpg)

The hello world of the 3D printing world... the first print had to be a [3D Benchy](https://www.3dbenchy.com/).

# Safety Upgrades

![Goodies to upgrade the printer](/assets/blog/printer/safety-upgrades.jpg)

The Anet A8 has [a bit of a reputation](https://www.fabbaloo.com/2018/12/3d-printer-safety-another-anet-a8-burns) for [catching on fire and burning your house down](https://www.thissmarthouse.net/dont-burn-your-house-down-3d-printing-a-cautionary-tale/) these upgrades are a must to ensure safety of using the printer.

- 30A power supply
- Mosfets
- Enable Thermal runaway in Marlin

I also ran 2 more cables to the heated bed to spread the current load between the extra pins on the heated bed as if the existing pins become loose they will melt the connector.

# Auto Bed Levelling

To enable auto bed levelling on the printer I used a Tronxy XY-08N.

![Auto Level Sensor Installed](/assets/blog/printer/auto-level-sensor.jpg)

The firmware to enable the sensor is available on [my Marlin Github repository](https://github.com/mikepthomas/Marlin/tree/2.0.x-Anet3D-V1-5)
