# Table of contents

# Cosina

## CSL

![A Cosina CSL Film Camera](/assets/blog/cameras/cosina-csl.jpg)

I wanted this to allow me to use M42 screw mount lenses from the [Zenit-E](#zenit-e) without having to use an external light meter as the one on the Zenith is not that accurate.

## CSR

![A Cosina CSR Film Camera](/assets/blog/cameras/cosina-csr.jpg)

I brought this as an upgrade to the [Cosina CSL](#csl), the only difference is that this also has a spot-metering option.

# Kodak

## No. 1 Pocket Kodak Jr

![No. 1 Pocket Kodak Jr ready to take pictures](/assets/blog/cameras/kodak-open.jpg)

I purchased this as I liked how it looked and did not know if it would actually work. I ran a roll of 120 film through it and to my surprise it actuallt took pictures.

## No. 2 Brownie Model F

![No. 2 Brownie Model F Open](/assets/blog/cameras/box-brownie-open.jpg)

This is in quite a poor state of repair therefore I have not tried it out as of yet.

# Minolta

## XG-M

![A great charity shop find](/assets/blog/cameras/minolta-xg-m.jpg)

This is the camera that got me hooked again on film photography. It was found in a charity shop in Penarth.

> This photo was taken on my [Nikon F-801](#f-801)

![Deep scratches on the side of a lens](/assets/blog/cameras/repaired-lens-scratched.jpg)

I purchased this lens as a broken item for Â£5 to have a play at stripping it down to clean and repair it. Although it is quite heavily scratched, it now works perfectly.

# Nikon

![My Nikon cameras with some accessories](/assets/blog/cameras/nikon-cameras.jpg)

## F-801

![A Nikon F-801 Film Camera](/assets/blog/cameras/nikon-f-801.jpg)

I brought this film camera as it has a Nikon F-Mount, the same lens mount as my DSLR camera allowing me to re-use lenses.

## D7000

![Screen on the top of a Nikon D7000](/assets/blog/cameras/nikon-d7000-screen.jpg)

I traded in my [Nikon D3100](#d3100) to [CEX](https://uk.webuy.com/) to purchase this.

# Praktica

## BMS

I have owned 2 of these however both have broken, failing to wind on.

## BC-1

![A Praktica BC 1 Film Camera](/assets/blog/cameras/praktica-bc-1.jpg)

My only working Praktica camera left

# Zenith

## Zenit-E

![A Zenit-E Film Camera](/assets/blog/cameras/zenit-e.jpg)

I have 2 Zenit-E cameras, one in Black and one in Silver. One has a Industar-50-20, the other with a HELIOS 44-2 lens.

# Film

![A roll of 35mm Film](/assets/blog/cameras/lomochrome-film.jpg)

## Developing

![Film developing chemicals](/assets/blog/cameras/chemicals.jpg)

It takes quite a few chemicals to develop the film...

![Tools for developing Black and White film](/assets/blog/cameras/developing.jpg)

...and requires a fair bit of clean up when you've finished.

![Developed film hanging up to dry](/assets/blog/cameras/developed-film.jpg)

Now that I ~have mastered~ am capable of developing Black and White film, should I now try developing colour?
