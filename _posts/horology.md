# Intro

After watching many [Wristwatch Revival videos on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/WristwatchRevival) I thought I would try my hand at `Horology`, the study of time and timekeeping devices.

As very much a beginner, I plan on trying the simplest thing possible to start and just assembling a wristwatch from its component parts, and if successful, will look into stripping down and servicing the movement.
