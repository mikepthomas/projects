# Intro

This project was to take a cheap 3D printer and make it better by upgrading components and 3D printing improved parts.

# Initial Upgrades

## Semi-Circular Anet A8 Fan Duct

[Fan duct from Thingyverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1954001) by user [lokster](https://www.thingiverse.com/lokster)

![Original Anet A8 Fan Duct](https://github.com/mikepthomas/mikepthomas.github.io/raw/develop/src/img/printer-printed-upgrades/original-fan-duct.jpg)

This was a required upgrade as the original Anet A8 fan duct started to melt.

## Anet A8 Extruder Button

[Extruder Button from Thingyverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2182276) by user [TabLeft](https://www.thingiverse.com/TabLeft)

To feed and remove the filament from the printer you have to press down quite hard on a small screw on the top of the extruder... this makes it a little less painful on the fingers.

## Anet A8 T corner

[Frame brace from Thingyverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1672959) by user [Electrico](https://www.thingiverse.com/Electrico)

![Anet A8 T corner](https://github.com/mikepthomas/mikepthomas.github.io/raw/develop/src/img/printer-printed-upgrades/t-corner.jpg)

This didn't stiffen up the frame as much as I would like... to improve print quality, it was replaced by the [Hulk Frame Brace for the Anet A8](#hulk-frame-brace-for-the-anet-a8).

# Cosmetic Upgrades

![Cosmetic Upgrades](https://github.com/mikepthomas/mikepthomas.github.io/raw/develop/src/img/printer-printed-upgrades/cosmetic-upgrades.jpg)

## Anet A8 Tool holder

[Tool holder from Thingyverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2072360) by user [ArcanePath](https://www.thingiverse.com/ArcanePath)

A tool holder to conveniently hold the allen keys and screwdrivers that came with the kit, on the left side of the frame.

## Anet A8: Tool Holder 2 (Right side)

[Tool holder from Thingyverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2086689) by user [ArcanePath](https://www.thingiverse.com/ArcanePath)

A tool holder to hold the spanner and side-cutters that came with the kit, on the right side of the frame.

## Anet A8 Anti Z-Wobble

[Anti Z-Wobble Adapters from Thingyverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2436455) by user [Tissat](https://www.thingiverse.com/Tissat)

I fitted these to help stop the Z axis lead screws from wobbling at the top of the printer, however the wobble is intentional as lead screws are rarely straight. I am still using them as they do not seem to be causing any detremental effect to my prints, but I know a lot of people say they cause more issues than they solve so YMMV.

## Anet A8 - M8 Nut Cap

[M8 Nut Cap from Thingyverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2357524) by user [Cyberlamb](https://www.thingiverse.com/Cyberlamb)

Covers the unsightly M8 nuts at the front of the frame.

## Anet A8 X axis belt holder

[X Axis belt holder from Thingyverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1666094) by user [kennethjiang](https://www.thingiverse.com/kennethjiang)

The stock way of attaching the belts is by folding the belt around some long screws on the back of the carriage and holding the ends together with cable ties. This makes attaching and adjusting the belt to the priner a little easier, as you no longer need to have the cable ties.

## Anet A8 USB Holder

[USB holder from Thingyverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2051881) by user [bonezzz](https://www.thingiverse.com/bonezzz)

A little holder for the Micro SD adapter that came with the kit. I mounted this to the screw at the top of the frame above the PSU.

# Electronics Upgrades

![Electronics Upgrades](https://github.com/mikepthomas/mikepthomas.github.io/raw/develop/src/img/printer-printed-upgrades/electronics-upgrades.jpg)

## Anet A8 - Micro SD Card Extension Cable Case with Card Storage

[SD Card Extender from Thingyverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2527250) by user [amrus2011](https://www.thingiverse.com/amrus2011)

![SD Card Extender](https://github.com/mikepthomas/mikepthomas.github.io/raw/develop/src/img/printer-printed-upgrades/sd-card-extender.jpg)

This allows me mount an [SD Card Extender](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B01C8CUDIQ) to move the SD card slot from the rear of the printer, to the front, to be able to easily insert and remove the SD card.

## Anet A8 Electronics Case

[Electronics Case from Thingyverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2670756) by user [FqFKrazz](https://www.thingiverse.com/FqFKrazz)

![Anet A8 Electronics Case](https://github.com/mikepthomas/mikepthomas.github.io/raw/develop/src/img/printer-printed-upgrades/electronics-case.jpg)

This electronics case was chosen as it is compatible with the [Hulk Frame Brace for the Anet A8](#hulk-frame-brace-for-the-anet-a8) and can house 2 [Mosfets](printer#safety-upgrades), one for the heated bed and one for the hotend.

![Anet A8 Electronics Case Mosfet](https://github.com/mikepthomas/mikepthomas.github.io/raw/develop/src/img/printer-printed-upgrades/mosfet.jpg)

The case, once installed really tidied up the printer's wires and made it easier to move around.

![Anet A8 Electronics Case Before and After](https://github.com/mikepthomas/mikepthomas.github.io/raw/develop/src/img/printer-printed-upgrades/electronics-case-before-after.jpg)

## Anet A8 30A PSU Adapter

[30 A PSU Adapter from Thingyverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2423368) by user [David_en8](https://www.thingiverse.com/David_en8)

The bolt pattern to mount the stock 20A power supply is different to the upgraded 30A supply, this adapter plate allows mounting the new supply without drilling new holes.

## PSU Cover Remix

[PSU Cover Remix from Thingyverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3344502) by user [MakerDan55](https://www.thingiverse.com/MakerDan55)

The printer doesn't have an on/off switch, this PSU cover allows you to fit a fused socket with a switch and also covers the live mains terminals on the power supply for safety.

## Rear Anet A8 mount for Raspberry Pi B with camera

[Raspberry Pi Mount from Thingyverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2133010) by user [Bksba](https://www.thingiverse.com/Bksba)

This mounts a Raspberry Pi to the rear of the frame behind the LCD, it also has a mount for a Raspberry Pi camera, to be used with [OctoPrint](https://octoprint.org/)

It is for the original Raspberry Pi B, which eventually became too slow to run the latest OctoPrint and was replaced with the [new Raspberry Pi 3B+ version](#rear-anet-a8-lcd-mount-for-raspberry-pi-3-with-camera)

![X-Axis Brackets](https://github.com/mikepthomas/mikepthomas.github.io/raw/develop/src/img/printer-printed-upgrades/x-axis-brackets.jpg)

Stiffens up the top of the frame. Leo_N's version did not fit my printer.

## Hulk Frame Brace for the Anet A8

[Frame brace from Thingyverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2189694) by user [Leo_N](https://www.thingiverse.com/Leo_N)

Stiffens up the frame to reduce ripples in the print related to the X carriage moving from side to side.

## Anet A8 Z Motor support

[Z Motor support from Thingyverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2010468) by user [ugge75](https://www.thingiverse.com/ugge75)

Supports the weight of the X-axis and carriage through the bottom of the Z stepper motors.

## Frame brace for Anet A8

[Frame Brace from Thingyverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1430727) by user [Simhopp](https://www.thingiverse.com/Simhopp)

I only printed the front frame brace from this, because I wanted the [rear frame brace with integrated motor mount](#frame-brace-with-y-axis-motor-mount-for-anet-a8). Stiffens up the front of the frame allowing the belt to be tightened without bending the acrylic frame.

## Frame brace with Y axis motor mount for Anet A8

[Rear Frame Brace from Thingyverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2350830) by user [ykimhi](https://www.thingiverse.com/ykimhi)

Rear frame brace with integrated mount for the Y Motor. Stiffens up the space between the bottom parts of the frame allowing the belt to be tightened without bending the acrylic frame.

## Anet A8 filament guide

[Filament Guide from Thingyverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1840645) by user [DRPrinting3D](https://www.thingiverse.com/DRPrinting3D)

I added this filament guide to stop the filament rubbing against the frame whilst printing.

# Motion Upgrades

![Motion Upgrades](https://github.com/mikepthomas/mikepthomas.github.io/raw/develop/src/img/printer-printed-upgrades/motion-upgrades.jpg)

## Anet A8 Improved X-belt Tensioner

[Belt Tensioner from Thingyverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1683070) by user [freemark](https://www.thingiverse.com/freemark)

Belt tensioner to allow fine adjustment of the X-Axis belt. This has been replaced with a [version that can accept a GT2 pulley with teeth](#anet-a8-x-belt-tensioner-for-gt2-pulley).

## Anet A8 Y belt tensioner

[Belt Tensioner from Thingyverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2149867) by user [CH35C0](https://www.thingiverse.com/CH35C0)

## Anet A8 lightweight and unobtrusive X-axis cable chain

[Cable Chain from Thingyverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2785408) by user [juh](https://www.thingiverse.com/juh)

![X-Axis Chain](https://github.com/mikepthomas/mikepthomas.github.io/raw/develop/src/img/printer-printed-upgrades/x-axis-chain.jpg)

This was replaced by [a different version](#anet-a8-x-axis-cable-chain-with-z-end-stop) after I upgraded to a [touch screen TFT screen](printer-hardware-upgrades#tft24-mount) to increase the available Z-Axis travel.

## Anet A8 Y-Axis Cable Chain v2

[Cable Chain from Thingyverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2115095) by user [The_Random_Engineer](https://www.thingiverse.com/The_Random_Engineer)

![Updated X-Axis Chain](https://github.com/mikepthomas/mikepthomas.github.io/raw/develop/src/img/printer-printed-upgrades/x-axis-chain-updated.jpg)

As I have removed the Z-Axis endstop when installing an [Auto Bed Levelling sensor](printer#auto-bed-levelling) I replaced the [cable chain motor mount with this version](#cable-chain-x-motor-mount).

## Cable Chain X Motor Mount

[Cable Chain from Thingyverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2551303) by user [AUREL_14](https://www.thingiverse.com/AUREL_14)

[Cable Chain from Thingyverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1905344) by user [Starwhooper](https://www.thingiverse.com/Starwhooper)

I only used the long cable chain and links with holes to enclose the cables with cable ties from this.

# Extruder Upgrades

![Extruder Upgrades](https://github.com/mikepthomas/mikepthomas.github.io/raw/develop/src/img/printer-printed-upgrades/extruder-upgrades.jpg)

## Anet A8 Extruder Fan Spacer

[Extruder Fan Spacer from Thingyverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1798669) by user [AZDawg](https://www.thingiverse.com/AZDawg)

Spacer for the extruder heat sink so that the fan does not splay out when the screws are tightened. This was replaced by the [3D Touch Mount](#anet-a8-bl-touch-mount).

## Anet A8 BL Touch Mount

[3D Touch Mount from Thingyverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4176326) by user [spencerx4](https://www.thingiverse.com/spencerx4)

# Bed Upgrades

![Bed Upgrades](https://github.com/mikepthomas/mikepthomas.github.io/raw/develop/src/img/printer-printed-upgrades/bed-upgrades.jpg)

## Anet A8 2 Piece Y Axis Belt Clamp

[Y-Axis Belt Clamp from Thingyverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2042514) by user [Gear_Down_For_What](https://www.thingiverse.com/Gear_Down_For_What)

A belt clamp to make attaching and adjusting the Y-Axis belt to the carriage easier.

## Anet A8 Bed Level Upgrade

[Bed Level Thumb Screws from Thingyverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2224250) by user [Malcy](https://www.thingiverse.com/Malcy)

Thumb screws to encase the bed levelling wing nuts to make them easier to adjust. These was removed as my screws are not long enough when I installed rigid silicone bed mounts.

## Anet A8 - Spring Bushing

[Spring Bushing from Thingyverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2357576) by user [Cyberlamb](https://www.thingiverse.com/Cyberlamb)

Bushings to encase the bed levelling springs, to stop them buckling under tension. These was removed when I installed rigid silicone bed mounts in place of the springs.

## Another Glass Heated Bed Holder for Anet A6&A8

[Glass Bed Holder from Thingyverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2842585) by user [aeozyalcin](https://www.thingiverse.com/aeozyalcin)

My glass bed was just a bit smaller than the heated bed so I printed these to replace the small bulldog clips to hold on the glass bed.

These got a bit melty whilst printing with the hotter bed temperatures ABS requires. This made the screws a little loose, I held them in a while with a bit of nail polish but the repeated heat expansion always made them become loose over time.

I have [remixed them to make them slightly thicker around the screw holes and modelled threads into the part](https://github.com/mikepthomas/3dprinting/blob/main/Designs/Glass%20Bed%20Holder%20Strengthened/Glass%20Bed%20Holder%20Strengthened.stl), allowing the threads to hold on a little tighter.
