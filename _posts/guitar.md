![Sourcing Smaller Parts](/assets/blog/guitar/02-finished-sourcing.jpg)

All the parts required to assemble the guitar have been purchased from Amazon. They were the cheapest parts I could find that fit the aesthetic I was going for.

# Printing Parts

## Attaching Neck

| Item                                                                       | Quantity | Material                                                    | Time    | Size   | Weight  | Cost  |      Printed       | Notes |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------- | ------ | ------- | ----- | :----------------: | ----- |
| [upper_center_dovetailed](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1241278/files) | 1        | [PrimaValue PLA (Red)](printer-filament#primavalue-pla-red) | 14h 57m | 73.77m | 220.01g | £5.30 | :heavy_check_mark: |       |

![First Part Attached (Front)](/assets/blog/guitar/03-first-part-front.jpg)

The parts were printed using a 1mm nozzle on my Anet A8 3D Printer. This is the only time I have used a nozzle different to the standard 0.4mm nozzle. I chose a larger nozzle to both print the parts faster but also ensure the parts come out strong.

![Installing the Right Side](/assets/blog/guitar/11-sides-install.jpg)

The right side of the guitar is clamped into place.

![Broken Part when Installing the Left Side](/assets/blog/guitar/12-almost-there.jpg)

Due to the use of the large nozzle, the tolerences for fitment were a little tight and a lot of force was needed to attach the sides, I unfortunately broke a few pieces when trying to fit them and needed to reprint.

## Finishing Up

![Body Assembled](/assets/blog/guitar/14-body-finished.jpg)

Installing the main electronics to the Pick Guard and attaching them to the guitar with blackened screws.

![Adding the Electronics](/assets/blog/guitar/15-electronics.jpg)

One of the last steps is to attch the Input Jack.

![Designed a Rear Cover](/assets/blog/guitar/16-rear-cover.jpg)

I designed the Tremolo cover in SketchUp 2017 and it is [available on my 3D printing GitHub repository](https://github.com/mikepthomas/3dprinting/blob/main/Designs/Guitar%20Tremolo%20Cover/Tremolo%20Cover.stl). You can also [view the design on the SketchUp website](https://app.sketchup.com/share/tc/europe/pxdZncLrWzY?stoken=gDHVrREtDf6Prk3EPKV8_tvkqZzCViiDa9BCoXuSLfEOKwwUwz-NuO2FCFrlYMM9&source=web).
